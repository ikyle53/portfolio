      "description": "I served 5 years in the navy in the medical field. I’ve mostly done physical labs jobs all my life. I decided to obtain a BA in digital media in 2019 and afterwards committed my efforts to becoming a software developer. People have acknowledged me as a pocket therapist with great attentive listening skills. Being in situations and jobs who’s conditions were inclement has helped me develop keener insight into how others perceive and feel, which I believe helps with understanding end-user experience. After losing my site on a job I knew software development would stick with me even in uncertain times. It’s been a dream of mine ever since I first received my first pc- a window 95 Emachine. I want to create software to help others achieve their goals and help create a better future for the next generation.",
